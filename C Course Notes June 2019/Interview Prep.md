# Interview Prep

## Preparation For The Interview

Composure - be relaxed but confident

Engaging - be sure to engage positively the interviewers.  If possible 'meet them' earlier on LinkedIn so you have an idea of what to expect of who the people are before you meet them.

Be sure to make eye contact when you first meet them, shake hands positively and try to relate to them as a human being rather than just someone who is interviewing you.

## General Questions

    Tell us about yourself
    Why did you join Sparta?
    Why did you choose tech?
    How do you see yourself in group?
    Talk about successes / problems & give example
    What do other people say about you?
    
    
    
    
    Tell me a little bit about yourself
    What degree do you have and why did you choose it?
    In a team setting what part do you play?  How do you see yourself?
    Do you have any work experience?  What have you done in the area of paid work?
    Before Sparta talk about 2 challenges that you have overcome
    What have been your biggest challenges here at Sparta?
    
    
    Perhaps brush up on all these questions via a video on your phone.  
    I know it sounds and feels silly but it can perhaps just get you over 
    those hurdles of explaining yourself.

## Basics

Expect the technical interview to be tough so check out all the following structures and know that you know them : Strings, Char, Byte, Boolean, Array, List, Strack, Queue, Struct, Enum, OOP, Class, Method, Fields, Properties, Constructor, Instance, Static, Abstract, Polymorphism, virtual, override, abstract and override, Interface - just be aware of, not in detail.

Loops - be prepared to do one on the wall.  If they asked you to do 'Fizz-Buzz' on the wall would you manage?  Try it in code and then on your wall.

Remember there are four loops : for, do, do.while and foreach over an array..  For loop is over fixed number.  While and do.while are over a condition eg loop while records exist to be read from a database.

    Agile : basics
    Waterfall : all-in-one
    Agile: DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY (WORKING CODE) IN INCREMENTS (SPRINT)
    Sprint : dev team + product owner (talk to customer) + scrum master (runs 'scrum/sprints' : enabler : servant leader)
    backlog = list of features which we are going to build
    user stories : 'humanise' tech features which we're going to build 'Joe clicks on 'users' , 'new' , enter new user and submit
    sprint backlog = mini-list of features just for this sprint
    
    
    SQL : basics
    
    
    C# : all core features  : data types, if.. , switch, loops (for, foreach, while, do.while)
    
    
    While vs Do..While()
    Collection
    Faster - Array or collection?
    x++;
    break;
    continue;
    
    
    OOP meaning
    4 pillars of OOP
    class
    method
    overload
    override
    virtual
    abstract class
    abstract method
    sealed class : has no child classes (useful for security)
    static keyword : attached to class
    collection
    array (fixed) vs collection(resize)
    list 
    queue : enqueue dequeue
    stack : push pop 
    stack memory (fast) 
    Note : Stack<int> is a place to store integers
    	 : Stack memory is a fast place in our computer where we store running programs
    heap memory (larger)
    value type : int char bool
    reference type : string array list  
    char[] array is same as string

SQL - know the basics.

Entity - just be aware of the basics, what Entity is (allows you to talk to a database easily, it's a Framework) and that it provides scaffolding ie builds your pages for you.  Entity from Database builds code from tables.  Entity from Code builds the tables from code.
